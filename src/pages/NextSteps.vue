      <p>If youâ€™re a CoronaTrace user and received a notification that you were in the proximity of someone who later tested positive for COVID-19, if a close contact of yours has tested positive or is showing symptoms of COVID-19, if you have started to show symptoms of COVID-19, or if you just want to be prepared, this guide is for you.</p>

          There are two immediate actions you should take if you have reason to believe you may have been exposed to COVID-19:
          <ol>
            <li>Call your doctor, healthcare provider, or a local medical center immediately.</li>
            <li>Cease contact with all other people and refrain entirely from leaving your home.</li>
          </ol>

          If you have reason to believe you may have been exposed to COVID-19, DO NOT seek medical attention in person unless you are experiencing emergency warning signs including:
          <ul>
            <li>Trouble breathing</li>
            <li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>
            <li>New confusion or inability to arouse</li>
            <li>Bluish lips or face</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>If you are experiencing one or more of these conditions, seek immediate medical attention.</b></p>
        <p>If you are not experiencing these symptoms, your first action should be to call a doctor, your healthcare provider, or medical center near you. Information on testing and treatment is different in every area so talking to a medical professional near you will give you the best information on how to proceed.</p>
        <p>Your medical professional should give you advice on how to proceed with treatment or testing based on questions about what symptoms you are showing, how you might have been exposed, and what risk factors you have which, combined with COVID-19, might require you to seek immediate medical attention.</p>
